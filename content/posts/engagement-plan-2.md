In the previous article, we've talked about what is & how we can make an engagement plan. Other than to help conceptualize & document your app's engagement method, we can use the concept of engagement plan to analyze what engagement methods are being used by other apps. For this article, we will be analysing down Forest app's engagement plan

# 4 Intrinsic Motivation

In the previous article, we've talked about 4 intrinsic motivations of people & how an engagement plan targets them. In an engagement plan analysis, we can use them again to separate methods use by the Forest app. Those 4 intrinsic motivations are:

  1. **Mastery:** The feedback of continuous improvement
  2. **Meaning:** The sense of accomplishment
  3. **Autonomy:** The ability to make a choice
  4. **Community:** The feeling of being needed

# Mastery

The Forest app tracks the exact time you do a pomodoro session, how long you do it for, and for what tag. At any time, you can see the statistics of previously done pomodoro by day, week, month, or year through the overview menu. This feature motivates you *rationally* by being able to check & compare the detailed progress of your focused-work session

Other than being able to see the detail statistics of your progress, the app also has a leaderboard & achievements feature. This further motivates you *rationally* by being a progress bar you can finished, and *emotionally* by being something you can brag about.

# Meaning

The Forest app have "Real Forest" program that partners with **Trees for the Future** -- tree-planting organizations -- to plant real trees on earth. If you opt for the pro version of the app, everytime you finished a pomodoro session, the forest team donates to its partner to have real trees planted.

This gives *emotional* attachment & motivation to us, telling us that not only do we gain mastery of our focus, but also helping the earth in the process.

If you don't feel like doing focused-work session, you can set custom phrases that will pops-up while you're doing a pomodoro session to *emotionally* boost your motivation & remind you why you're doing it.

# Autonomy

Before you start a pomodoro session, you can choose what type of tree to plant. The types of trees you can plant is varied, ranging from pine trees, cherry blossoms, cactus, bamboo, even to decorations such as a carved pumpkin & tree house.

You can buy any of those type of trees using the currency you get every time you completed a pomodoro session. These customization options give an *emotional* attachment between you & your virtual forest.

Other than that, you can customize your pomodoro setup quite extensively. You can change the tag to describe what you're working on, change the mode between timer & stopwatch, and set the session timer accordingly. This gives a lot of *rational* autonomy towards your focused-work session.

# Community

In the Forest app, you can invite your friend / work group to do the pomodoro session together. If one of you break the pomodoro session, everyone in the group will get the consequence of breaking their session too. This give an *emotional* responsibility & accountability towards your work session, so that you'll less likely slacking off.

At certain time periods, you can also buy limited types of trees. If you managed to save up & buy them, you can share them to your friends as a bragging point. This give a lot of *emotional* satisfaction & a topic to talk about.
