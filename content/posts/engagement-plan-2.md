In the previous article, we've talked about what is & how we can make an engagement plan. Other than to help conceptualize & document your app's engagement method, we can use the concept of engagement plan to analyze what engagement methods are being used by other apps. For this article, we will be analysing down Forest app's engagement plan

# 4 Intrinsic Motivation

In the previous article, we've talked about 4 intrinsic motivations of people & how an engagement plan targets them. In an engagement plan analysis, we can use them again to separate methods use by the Forest app. Those 4 intrinsic motivations are:

  1. **Mastery:** The feedback of continuous improvement
  2. **Meaning:** The sense of accomplishment
  3. **Autonomy:** The ability to make a choice
  4. **Community:** The feeling of being needed

# Mastery

The Forest app tracks the exact time you do a pomodoro session, how long you do it for, and for what tag. At any time, you can see the statistics of previously done pomodoro by day, week, month, or year through the overview menu. This feature motivates you *rationally* by being able to check & compare the detailed progress of your focused-work session

Other than being able to see the detail statistics of your progress, the app also has a leaderboard & achievements feature. This further motivates you *rationally* by being a progress bar you can finished, and *emotionally* by being something you can brag about.

# Meaning

The Forest app have "Real Forest" program that partners with **Trees for the Future** -- tree-planting organizations -- to plant real trees on earth. If you opt for the pro version of the app, everytime you finished a pomodoro session, the forest team donates to its partner to have real trees planted.

This gives *emotional* attachment & motivation to us, telling us that not only do we gain mastery of our focus, but also helping the earth in the process.

If you don't feel like doing focused-work session, you can set custom phrases that will pops-up while you're doing a pomodoro session to *emotionally* boost your motivation & remind you why you're doing it.
