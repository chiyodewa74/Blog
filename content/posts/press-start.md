Hi!

Welcome to my very own personal blog! Professionally, I am a game designer from Jakarta, Indonesia. However, I have lots of hobbies, such as games, photography, AI, cyber security, and tea drinking. Everything I have time to explore I will document it on this blog every two weeks.

As you might guess, this blog is going to look a bit directionless. But that's exactly who I am, taking, learning, and doing whatever comes to mind. Don't worry, I'll try to keep this blog a bit organized by using the [series](/blog/series/) tags. You can choose which series to read through the button at the top right of the screen. If you want to see all posts available, check out [archive](/blog/archives/).

I will also write an update in the form of a blog post every 2 months about the condition of this blog and what I might write in the future.

So, have fun reading my messy blog. And if you have any comments, input, suggestions, or anything, I will try to always open the comments column for all blog posts except this post and maybe the next update posts. Thank you!
