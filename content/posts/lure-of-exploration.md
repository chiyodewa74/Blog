So, I just started playing Genshin Impact this past weekend. I know I'm a bit late (like 2 years late), but it's a long weekend and I figured I might just download it and see what the fuss is all about. And damn, am I addicted to it.

{{<figure alt="Teyvat Genshin Impact world" attr="Teyvat, Genshin Impact's world" src="https://chiyodewa74.github.io/posts/lure-of-exploration/cover.jpg">}}

I've been playing it nonstop for the past 3 days, to the point where my daily routine is all messed up now. Exploring the massive world of Teyvat, amazed by the surrounding environment along the way, and of course, praying to the gacha lord I'd get a 5-star character in the next wish.

But one thing that's been pulling me to open up Genshin over and over again is the lure of exploration it gives. Every nook and cranny in Teyvat is filled with chests, puzzles, quests, lore snippets, and deep mysteries.

Like the Chi of Yore quest at Qingce Village. In this lengthy quest, you have to find 3 hidden artifacts around Qingce Village and Wuwang Hills to open a gate to a supposedly hidden treasure. In just this one quest, players have to run around a little corner of Bishui Plains, absorb the beautiful environment and vibe of it, and sometimes get sidetracked by another side quest. That's fine though, cause once you finish the quest line of Chi of Yore, it's satisfying enough to make you wonder what mysteries are still uncovered in the area.

That kind of experience is what keeps dragging me to play Genshin through this whole weekend. It reminds me of the year 2013 when I first started playing The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim. The sheer massiveness and liveliness of the game world really keep me playing for a couple of months.
