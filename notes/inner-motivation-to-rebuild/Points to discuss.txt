Points to discuss:
- Sudden motivation to do big things every big occassion
- That motivation will dwindle. Why?
- Everything that we want to do (motivation), comes from our needs
- Needs have hierarchy
- Make sure the lower level is achieved, then move on to the next
- I do workout because i need it to keep me healthy (safety needs)
